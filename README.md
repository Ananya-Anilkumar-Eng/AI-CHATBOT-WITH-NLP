# DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on creating a chatbot using the natural processing libraries like _**NLTK and Spacy**_. The chatbot I have created basically generates few dad jokes whenever the user asks. It is avery basic task but yet I did explored about NLP. This task compared to the previous two tasks was difficult yet I managed to complete it.

The task was performed in Jupyter Notebook and can also be performed in Python IDLE, Spyder, VS Code with necessary modules available.The modules used are **nltk ,json, string, random**
